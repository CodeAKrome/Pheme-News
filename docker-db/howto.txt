How It Works
Setup:
Docker Compose starts three services: web (FastAPI), mongodb (MongoDB), and chroma (Chroma DB).
FastAPI connects to MongoDB at mongodb://mongodb:27017 and Chroma at http://chroma:8000.
The app listens on port 1337.
Uploading Records (POST /records/):
Accepts a JSONL string (e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 30}\n{"name": "Jane", "age": 25}).
Stores raw records in MongoDB's records collection.
Converts each JSON record to a text string (e.g., name:John age:30) for embedding.
Adds embeddings to Chroma with the MongoDB _id as the Chroma document ID.
Field-Based Search (GET /records/search/):
Unchanged from the previous solution.
Searches MongoDB using exact field matches (e.g., ?name=John&age=30).
Vector Search (POST /records/vector-search/):
Accepts a JSON body with query_text (e.g., name:John age:30) and optional top_k (default 5).
Queries Chroma for the top top_k similar records, returning their IDs (MongoDB _id strings).
Fetches the corresponding records from MongoDB by _id and returns them.
Web Interface:
Access http://localhost:1337/docs for Swagger UI to test all endpoints.
Example Usage
Start the services:
bash

docker-compose up -d
Upload records:
bash

curl -X POST "http://localhost:1337/records/" -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data $'{"name": "John", "age": 30}\n{"name": "Jane", "age": 25}\n{"name": "John", "city": "New York"}'
Response:
json

[
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890123", "data": {"name": "John", "age": 30}},
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890124", "data": {"name": "Jane", "age": 25}},
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890125", "data": {"name": "John", "city": "New York"}}
]
Field-based search:
bash

curl "http://localhost:1337/records/search/?name=John"
Response:
json

[
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890123", "data": {"name": "John", "age": 30}},
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890125", "data": {"name": "John", "city": "New York"}}
]
Vector search:
bash

curl -X POST "http://localhost:1337/records/vector-search/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query_text": "name:John", "top_k": 2}'
Response (returns records similar to name:John):
json

[
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890123", "data": {"name": "John", "age": 30}},
    {"id": "671a9b1f2c3d4e5f67890125", "data": {"name": "John", "city": "New York"}}

Notes
Embedding Model: Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from Sentence Transformers for lightweight, efficient embeddings. You can swap to other models (e.g., paraphrase-MiniLM-L12-v2) by updating db.py.
Chroma Persistence: The chroma_data volume ensures embeddings persist across container restarts.
JSON to Text: The _json_to_text method converts JSON to a simple string (e.g., name:John age:30). You can customize this for more sophisticated text representations.
Performance: Chroma is lightweight and suitable for small to medium datasets. For large-scale production, consider scaling Chroma or using a managed vector DB.
Security: Add authentication and environment variables for production use.
References: Inspired by Chroma documentation and FastAPI-MongoDB integration guides.
This solution enhances the previous version by adding vector search capabilities while maintaining the existing functionality. Let me know if you need further refinements or additional features!
