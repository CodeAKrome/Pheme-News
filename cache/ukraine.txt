emphasized that the <NORP>Central European</NORP> country not only favors involving <GPE>Moscow</GPE> in <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> talks but is also working toward that goal.\"Since the very beginning,

said <PERSON>Alexander Konkov</PERSON>, associate professor of <ORG>the Financial University</ORG> run by the <NORP>Russian</NORP> government.Even as <GPE>Switzerland</GPE> is not an <ORG>EU</ORG>

<GPE>Ukraine</GPE>’s failures on the battlefield, with the latest being the loss of <GPE>Ugledar</GPE>.He had big hopes for the <PERSON>Ramstein</PERSON> meeting originally scheduled to take place in <GPE>Germany</GPE> on <DATE>October 12</DATE>, but the organizers canceled the meeting without explaining why.On <DATE>Thursday</DATE>, <NORP>Russian</NORP> Foreign Minister <PERSON>Sergey

<LOC>the</LOC> situation has deteriorated amid <ORG>NATO</ORG>’s intentions to militarize <LOC>the</LOC> region.Earlier, <PERSON>Daniel Kritenbrink</PERSON>, <GPE>US</GPE> Assistant Secretary of <ORG>State</ORG> for <NORP>East Asian</NORP> and Pacific Affairs, announced that <GPE>Washington</GPE> plans to discuss human rights in <GPE>Myanmar</GPE>, what he called <GPE>China</GPE>’s reckless behavior in the South <GPE>China</GPE> Sea, where it has had sporadic clashes with <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> member countries over territorial claims, and <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>.Over <DATE>the past year</DATE>, since <GPE>Russia</GPE> has singled out <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> as a priority in its foreign policy doctrine, there has been no breakthrough in relations between <GPE>Russia</GPE> and the <NORP>Southeast Asian</NORP> union - and none was expected, Deputy Director of <ORG>HSE Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies</ORG> <PERSON>Alexander Korolev</PERSON> told <ORG>Vedomosti</ORG>.Rather, he said, <GPE>Russia</GPE> continues to develop relations with individual <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> member countries, primarily <GPE>Malaysia</GPE>, whose Prime Minister <PERSON>Anwar Ibrahim</PERSON> talked cooperation in <NORP>Islamic</NORP> banking at <EVENT>the Eastern Economic Forum</EVENT> in <GPE>Russia</GPE> and has been actively campaigning for his country's membership in <ORG>BRICS</ORG>, as have been <GPE>Vietnam</GPE>, <GPE>Myanmar</GPE> and <GPE>Indonesia</GPE>.According to <PERSON>Korolev</PERSON>, even as <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> has dodged any discussions on <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>, the topic still comes up at these twice yearly events.The talk, however, centers around the <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> conflict’s impact on food and energy security rather than its military and political implications.Therefore, <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> will formally refrain from taking sides with either <GPE>Russia</GPE> or the <LOC>West</LOC>, even as <ORG>ASEAN</ORG> diplomats often signal at informal meetings that they support <GPE>Russia</GPE>, the expert concluded.Developing cooperation between <GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE> in <LOC>Eurasia</LOC>, especially in <LOC>Central Asia</LOC>, will help the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> countries build a more just world order globally that reaps rewards for as many countries from <LOC>the Global South</LOC>, or what <GPE>Moscow</GPE> calls the global majority, as possible.At that, the <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> countries should focus on pragmatic aspects and mutual benefits rather than trying to oppose the <LOC>West</LOC> in their work, according to a joint report from <ORG>the Russian International Affairs Council</ORG>, <ORG>the Institute of China and Contemporary Asia</ORG> at <ORG>the Russian Academy of Sciences</ORG> and the <GPE>Shanghai-based</GPE> <ORG>Fudan University</ORG> seen by <ORG>Kommersant</ORG>.The <DATE>annual</DATE> report titled <WORK_OF_ART><GPE>Russia</GPE>n-Chinese

relations.Among major conclusions, the report said that <GPE>Moscow</GPE> and <GPE>Beijing</GPE> should work together to develop relations with <LOC>Central Asia</LOC>, a key element of the Greater Eurasian Partnership Concept introduced by <GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE>’s <ORG>Belt and Road Initiative</ORG> and the nucleus of <ORG>the Shanghai Cooperation Organization</ORG> (<ORG>SCO</ORG>), to prevent the region from becoming another zone of competition.The joint role <GPE>Moscow</GPE> and <GPE>Beijing</GPE> are playing to develop the <ORG>SCO</ORG> and <ORG>BRICS</ORG> as brand-new international platforms is also key, the authors of the report insist.Both groups have expanded in political terms in <DATE>2024</DATE>, with <ORG>BRICS</ORG> doubling from <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> to <CARDINAL>10</CARDINAL> member countries and the <ORG>SCO</ORG>, too, increasing the number of its members to <CARDINAL>10</CARDINAL>.\"<GPE>Russia</GPE> and <GPE>China</GPE> are the driving forces behind <ORG>BRICS</ORG>  for the bulk of substantive initiatives originate from these <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> countries.In addition, <GPE>Russia</GPE> plays a leading role in aligning large players struggling to solve major disputes between themselves politically, such as <GPE>China</GPE> and <GPE>India</GPE> or <GPE>Iran</GPE> and <GPE>Saudi

<ORG>BRICS</ORG> summit told reporters that the grouping’s gathering in <GPE>Kazan</GPE> <DATE>later this month</DATE> could \"become the largest foreign policy event ever held in our country.\"So far, <CARDINAL>32</CARDINAL> countries have sent confirmations to attend the summit to which <CARDINAL>as many as 38</CARDINAL> countries, including <ORG>BRICS</ORG> member countries and nations seeking cooperation with the intergovernmental organization have been invited, <PERSON>Ushakov</PERSON> said.All <CARDINAL>ten</CARDINAL> <ORG>BRICS</ORG> member countries have agreed to take part, he added.Also, countries that chair regional integration associations in <LOC>Southeast Asia</LOC>, <LOC>Africa</LOC>, <LOC>Latin America</LOC> and <LOC>the Middle East</LOC> have been invited.The summit

of <ORG>BRICS</ORG> decided to expand at <DATE>last year’s</DATE> summit in <GPE>South Africa</GPE>, there are limited opportunities to accept more members, <PERSON>Yaroslav Lisovolik</PERSON>, founder of the <ORG>BRICS</ORG>+ Analytics company, said, as additional criteria and conditions for further expansion need to be formulated.However, there are <CARDINAL>tens</CARDINAL> of countries who would like to work with <ORG>BRICS</ORG>, the expert added.\"This is why the idea to establish a ‘belt of friends’ looks justified,\" <PERSON>Lisovolik</PERSON> told <ORG>Vedomosti</ORG>.The expert pointed to the growing interest in settlements in national currencies among <ORG>BRICS</ORG>.Additional payment systems could meet the rising demand for transactions between them.Merging the digital currency platforms of central banks from <ORG>BRICS</ORG> countries and their partners is the most interesting idea, he said.Multiple ideas and proposals have been announced ahead of the summit in <GPE>Kazan</GPE>, <PERSON>Denis Denisov</PERSON>, an expert at <ORG>the Financial University</ORG> run by the <NORP>Russian</NORP> government, said.These include setting up an alternative to <ORG>SWIFT</ORG> not only for the sake of financial diversification but also amid the West’s ability to impose sanctions on economies that it does not like within <TIME>hours</TIME>, the expert explained.<GPE>Russia</GPE> expects that foreign companies will largely cease to exit its market as it included a substantial decrease in revenues from gratuitous payments into its draft budget for <DATE>the next three years</DATE>, including those from the sale of assets of foreign owners, to a symbolic <MONEY>300 mln rubles</MONEY> ($<MONEY>3 mln</MONEY>) <DATE>annually</DATE> from <MONEY>141 bln rubles</MONEY> ($<MONEY>1.45 bln</MONEY>) that the authority expects to receive <DATE>this year</DATE>, <ORG>Izvestia</ORG> has learned.As the government has lowered expectations for gratuitous revenues in <DATE>2025-2027</DATE>, it obviously does not pencil in any major exit of foreigners, <PERSON>Natalya Milchakova</PERSON>, a lead analyst at <ORG>Freedom Finance Global</ORG>, argues.\"The majority of foreign owners who wanted to leave <GPE>Russia</GPE> have already done so - or will do so before <DATE>the end of 2024</DATE> - by paying a <PERCENT>15%</PERCENT> fee.So, the government has perhaps achieved its goal - to let politically neutral foreign companies stay, especially when it comes to large market players,\" she said.Over <DATE>the past two years</DATE>, <ORG>McDonald's</ORG>, <ORG>Shell</ORG>, <ORG>Siemens</ORG>, <ORG>Nissan</ORG>, <ORG>IKEA</ORG> and other large global businesses have departed from <GPE>Russia</GPE>.In <DATE>2024</DATE> alone,

<CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> being tax and non-tax revenues, <PERSON>Vladimir Klimanov</PERSON> from <ORG>the Presidential Academy</ORG> explained.However, these revenues are not critical for <GPE>Russia</GPE>’s coffers, he said.According to <PERSON>Milchakova</PERSON>, they accounted for a mere <PERCENT>2%</PERCENT> of all budget revenues or <PERCENT>0.6%</PERCENT> of GDP <DATE>this

expecting others to lose or trying to stay ahead by suppressing the development of other countries,\" he said.<PERSON>Zhang</PERSON> said that major country should behave in a way commensurate with its status, and work together with others to maintain stable international relations, rather than putting the interests of their own over the common interests of the international community or seeking dominance and dictating the whole world.\"The world is once again at a historical crossroads.We call on all peace-loving countries to unite under the banner of the <ORG>UN</ORG>, practice true

Independent Premium section, under my profile This election is still a dead heat, according to most polls.Military chiefs are considering sending <NORP>British</NORP> troops to <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> to train soldiers and boost <GPE>Kyiv</GPE>’s recruitment efforts, it has emerged.<ORG>Ministry of Defence</ORG> (<ORG>MoD</ORG>) sources confirmed to <ORG>The Independent</ORG> that discussions are ongoing about whether to send troops to the country to support it amid <GPE>Russia</GPE>’s ongoing invasion.There is already a small number of <NORP>British</NORP> medical personnel in <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>, delivering training and mentoring to the country’s armed forces.And, under plans being discussed, small groups of military trainers would travel to secluded locations in the west of the country to provide intensive training to new recruits before they are deployed to the front line in the east.<CARDINAL>Two</CARDINAL> sources told <ORG>The Times</ORG> the plans would solve some of the logistical issues that come with sending <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> troops to <GPE>UK</GPE> bases for training and to save money.The plans emerged as <PERSON>Volodymyr Zelensky</PERSON> visited <FAC>10 Downing Street</FAC> for talks with Sir <PERSON>Keir Starmer</PERSON> amid a <NORP>European</NORP> tour to drum up further support for <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>’s campaign against <GPE>Russia</GPE>.The <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> president and the prime minister embraced outside <FAC>No 10</FAC> before a series of talks also involving <ORG>Nato</ORG>’s new secretary-general <PERSON>Mark Rutte</PERSON>.<GPE>Britain</GPE> has trained <CARDINAL>tens of thousands</CARDINAL> of <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> soldiers in the <GPE>UK</GPE> under <EVENT>Operation Interflex</EVENT>, but defence secretary <PERSON>John Healey</PERSON> said <DATE>last month</DATE> that the “biggest constraint” to the scheme is <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> sending the personnel over to be trained.<CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> source told <ORG>The Times</ORG> doing the training in <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> would be “cheaper for us and better for them”, adding that “we could do it quicker out there and it would be very far away from the front line, in secluded locations, so the risk would be much lower”.A <GPE>Kyiv</GPE> source said transferring the training to <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> would send a “powerful military-political signal” to <GPE>Russia</GPE> and serve as a “powerful deterrent” to <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON>.Former defence secretary <PERSON>Grant Shapps</PERSON> <DATE>last year</DATE> suggested <GPE>Britain</GPE> could deploy military instructors to western <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> as well as encourage defence firms to ramp up manufacturing in the country.However, an <ORG>MoD</ORG> source told <ORG>The Independent</ORG> that while talks have been ongoing for some time, the cost and security considerations would be “colossal” and the move is “nowhere close” to being made.A spokesman for the department said: “Our support for <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> is ironclad, the Defence Secretary recently confirmed the extension of <EVENT>Operation Interflex</EVENT> to run throughout <DATE>2025</DATE>.We remain in close discussion with our <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> partners as to how we can provide the best possible training offer.”The visit was Mr <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON>’s <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> trip to Number <CARDINAL>10</CARDINAL> since Sir <PERSON>Keir</PERSON> came to power after he addressed an extraordinary meeting of the <ORG>Cabinet</ORG> in <DATE>July</DATE>.The <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> leader and <GPE>UK</GPE> PM met most recently at <FAC>the United Nations</FAC> in <GPE>New York</GPE> <DATE>last month</DATE>.Mr <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> has been presenting his “victory plan” to <NORP>Western</NORP> leaders as he lobbies for greater military assistance, such as permission to use equipment including <GPE>UK-supplied</GPE> <PRODUCT>Storm Shadow</PRODUCT> missiles to hit targets within <GPE>Russia</GPE>.Welcoming Mr <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> in <FAC>No 10’s</FAC> <FAC>Pillared Room</FAC>, Sir <PERSON>Keir</PERSON> said it was “very important we’re able to show our continued commitment to support <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>” and it was a chance to “go through the plan, to talk in more detail”.The pair then held private talks in <FAC>the Small Dining Room</FAC> before conversations involving their wider teams.Mr <PERSON>Healey</PERSON>, chief of the defence staff Admiral Sir <PERSON>Tony Radakin</PERSON> and national security adviser Sir <PERSON>Tim Barrow</PERSON> were among the senior figures involved in the meeting with the <NORP>Ukrainians</NORP>.Ahead of <DATE>Thursday</DATE>’s visit, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said the meeting with Mr <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> would involve “broad strategic discussions” on <GPE>UK</GPE> and allied support for <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> during a “crucial period”, rather than specific decisions.But the <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> leader is likely to once again press for permission to use long-range <PRODUCT>Storm Shadow</PRODUCT> missiles to strike the airbases used to launch attacks on his country, as well as other key <NORP>Russian</NORP> targets.The <GPE>UK</GPE> and <GPE>US</GPE> have so far stopped short of explicitly giving <GPE>Kyiv</GPE> permission to fire Western-supplied missiles at targets within <PERSON>Vladimir Putin’s</PERSON> country over concerns about further escalating the conflict, but Mr <PERSON>Zelensky</PERSON> has likened his position to having to fight with his hands tied.<ORG>Downing Street</ORG> said on <DATE>Wednesday</DATE> that the <GPE>UK</GPE>’s position on using

"<ORG>Nihon Hidankyo</ORG>, a <NORP>Japanese</NORP> group of atomic bomb survivors, has won the <DATE>2024</DATE> <WORK_OF_ART>Nobel Peace Prize</WORK_OF_ART>.Known as hibakusha, the survivors of the <DATE>1945</DATE> bombings of <GPE>Hiroshima</GPE> and <EVENT>Nagasaki</EVENT> have been recognised by the <NORP>Norwegian</NORP> <ORG>Nobel Committee</ORG> for efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.<ORG>Nobel Committee</ORG> Chair <PERSON>Joergen Watne Frydnes</PERSON> said the group had \"contributed greatly to the establishment of the nuclear taboo\".Mr <PERSON>Frydnes</PERSON> warned the \"nuclear taboo\" was now \"under pressure\" - and praised the group's use of witness testimony to ensure nuclear weapons must never be used again.Founded in <DATE>1956</DATE>, the organisation sends survivors around the world to share their testimonies of the \"atrocious damage\" and suffering caused by the use of nuclear weapons, according to its website.Their work began <DATE>almost a decade</DATE> after the devastation of <GPE>Hiroshima</GPE> and <GPE>Nagasaki</GPE>.On <DATE>6 August 1945</DATE>, a <GPE>US</GPE> bomber dropped the uranium bomb above the city of <GPE>Hiroshima</GPE>, killing <CARDINAL>around 140,000</CARDINAL> people.<DATE>Three days later</DATE> a <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> nuclear weapon was dropped on <GPE>Nagasaki</GPE>.<DATE>Two weeks later</DATE> <GPE>Japan</GPE> surrendered, ending <EVENT>World War Two</EVENT>.Speaking to reporters in <GPE>Japan</GPE>, a tearful <PERSON>Toshiyuki Mimaki</PERSON>, the co-head of the group, said: \"Never did I dream this could happen,\" the <ORG>AFP</ORG> news agency quotes him as saying.Mr <PERSON>Mimaki</PERSON> criticised the idea that nuclear weapons bring peace.\"It has been said that because of nuclear weapons, the world maintains peace.But nuclear weapons can be used by terrorists,\" Mr <PERSON>Mimaki</PERSON> said, according to reports by <ORG>AFP</ORG>.In a <ORG>BBC</ORG> interview <DATE>last year</DATE>, he said despite only being <DATE>three years old</DATE> at the time the nuclear bomb hit <GPE>Hiroshima</GPE> - he could still remember dazed and burnt survivors fleeing past his home.The prize - which consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a sum of $<MONEY>1m</MONEY> (£<MONEY>765,800</MONEY>) - will be presented at a ceremonies in <GPE>Oslo</GPE> in <DATE>December</DATE>, marking the anniversary of the death of the scientist and prize creator <PERSON>Alfred Nobel</PERSON>.The group has been nominated for <WORK_OF_ART>the Nobel Peace Prize</WORK_OF_ART> \"many times\" in the past, including in <DATE>2005</DATE> when it received a special mention by <ORG>the Norwegian Nobel Committee</ORG>, its website says.The decision to recognise <PERSON>Nihon Hidankyo</PERSON> means the <WORK_OF_ART>Nobel</WORK_OF_ART> committee has steered away from more controversial nominees for the peace prize.There had been widespread speculation the <ORG>United Nations</ORG> agency supporting <NORP>Palestinians</NORP> – <ORG>UNRWA</ORG> – was being considered for the prize.Although the organisation is the main provider of humanitarian aid to civilians in <GPE>Gaza</GPE>, <CARDINAL>nine</CARDINAL> of its members were fired for alleged involvement in the <ORG>Hamas</ORG> attack on <GPE>Israel</GPE> on <DATE>October 7 last year</DATE>.<CARDINAL>More than 12,000</CARDINAL> people had signed a petition urging the committee not to award <ORG>UNRWA</ORG> the prize.There were equal concerns about the nomination of <ORG>the International Court of Justice</ORG>.The <ORG>UN</ORG>’s main judicial organ is currently considering allegations that <GPE>Israel</GPE> has committed genocide in <GPE>Gaza</GPE> and has already issued a statement urging the <GPE>Israel</GPE>i authorities to refrain from genocidal acts.But while giving the prize to <PERSON>Nihon Hidankyo</PERSON> may be a non-controversial choice, it could also focus global attention on the threat of nuclear conflict which overshadows the fighting in both <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> and <LOC>the Middle East</LOC>.Throughout <GPE>Russia</GPE>’s invasion of <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>, its leaders have repeatedly hinted that they may be ready to use tactical nuclear weapons if western allies increase their support for <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> in a way <GPE>Russia</GPE> considers unacceptable.These threats have succeeded in restraining western support for fear of escalation.In <LOC>the Middle East</LOC>, the subtext for much of <GPE>Israel</GPE>’s strategy is the fear that <GPE>Iran</GPE> is seeking nuclear capability, something <GPE>Tehran</GPE> denies.The <ORG>Nobel</ORG> committee’s decision may renew a debate about the use of nuclear weapons at a time when some countries look enviously at their deterring power.This <DATE>year</DATE>'s peace prize had <CARDINAL>286</CARDINAL> nominations, a number comprising <CARDINAL>197</CARDINAL> individuals and <CARDINAL>89</CARDINAL> organisations.Nominations can be made by people in positions of significant authority, including members of national assemblies, governments and international courts of law.<NORP><GPE>Iran</GPE>ian</NORP> human rights activist <PERSON>Narges Mohammadi</PERSON> won the prize in <DATE>2023</DATE>, when she was honoured for her work fighting the oppression of women in <GPE>Iran</GPE>.Ms <PERSON>Mohammadi</PERSON> is currently being held in <FAC>Evin</FAC> prison in <GPE>Tehran</GPE>, having already spent <DATE>12 years</DATE> in jail serving multiple sentences related to her activism.<ORG>Alimentation Couche-Tard</ORG> reportedly offered to pay <MONEY>over $47bn</MONEY> for the <NORP>Japanese-owned</NORP> retail giant.A government spokesperson admitted \"minor editing\" had been made to the image after online speculation.<PERSON>Jane Hasell-McCosh</PERSON> has been awarded <WORK_OF_ART>The Order of the Rising Sun</WORK_OF_ART> by the <NORP>Japanese</NORP> government.A bomb, probably dropped in <EVENT>WW2</EVENT>, goes off at an airport, <TIME>about a minute</TIME> after a passenger plane passed by.<PERSON>Masato Kanda</PERSON> unleashed <MONEY>an estimated 25 trillion yen</MONEY> to support the currency when it slumped against the dollar."
"The government is carrying out <CARDINAL>37</CARDINAL> investigations into <GPE>UK-linked</GPE> businesses for potentially breaking <NORP>Russian</NORP> oil sanctions - but no fines have been handed out so far, the <ORG>BBC</ORG> can reveal.The identities of the businesses are unknown but it is understood some are likely to be maritime insurance firms.The <ORG>Treasury</ORG> said it would take action where appropriate, but pointed to the complexity of the cases as a reason they take considerable time.But Sir <PERSON>William Browder</PERSON>, a longstanding critic of <NORP>Russian</NORP> President <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON>, said it was an \"embarrassment\" that there had not been a single prosecution or fine for companies investigated for potentially breaching oil sanctions.Financial sanctions on <GPE>Russia</GPE> were introduced by the <GPE>UK</GPE> and other <NORP>Western</NORP> countries following the invasion of <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> in <DATE>2022</DATE>.The sanctions include a cap on the price of <NORP><GPE>Russia</GPE>n</NORP> oil, designed to ensure that oil can keep flowing without <GPE>Russia</GPE> making large profits.The cap prohibits <NORP>British</NORP> businesses from facilitating the transportation of <NORP>Russian</NORP> oil sold <MONEY>above $60</MONEY> a barrel.Sir <PERSON>William</PERSON>, who heads <ORG>the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign</ORG>, told the <ORG>BBC</ORG> the <GPE>UK</GPE> \"was one of the most lax enforcers of these types of laws\".He added: \"The <GPE>UK</GPE> doesn’t do prosecutions well and I don’t know if that can be fixed overnight.\"There seems to be both a resource problem and a culture problem when it comes to prosecuting people for economic crimes or sanctions evasion here.\"Critics have claimed sanctions are ineffective after the latest figures showed the <NORP>Russian</NORP> economy was growing.Data obtained by the <ORG>BBC</ORG> using <LAW>Freedom of Information</LAW> laws shows the <ORG>Treasury</ORG> has opened investigations into <CARDINAL>52</CARDINAL> companies with a connection to the <GPE>UK</GPE> suspected of breaching the price cap since <DATE>December 2022</DATE>.As of <DATE>August</DATE>, <CARDINAL>37</CARDINAL> of those investigations were live and <CARDINAL>15</CARDINAL> had concluded, but no fines had been handed out.<PERSON>Louis Wilson</PERSON>, the head of fossil fuel investigations at anti-corruption organisation <ORG>Global Witness</ORG> said it was “quite astonishing” that no fines have yet been handed out.He described the oil cap as a “a sort of paper tiger” that is failing to crack down on rule breaking.If the <GPE>UK</GPE> government “prevents <NORP>British</NORP> businesses from enabling <PERSON>Putin</PERSON>'s profiteering, then I think you'll start to see others following that lead,” he added.Investigations into potential breaches of the oil cap and other financial sanctions are carried out by a <ORG>Treasury</ORG> unit called <ORG>the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation</ORG> (<ORG>OFSI</ORG>).<ORG>OFSI</ORG> received an extra £<MONEY>50m</MONEY> of funding in <DATE>March</DATE> to improve enforcement of the <GPE>UK</GPE>’s sanctions regime But Mr <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> said companies under investigation find it “pretty easy to come by” a document that gets them out of trouble.He described the documents as “basically promises, voluntary bits of paper” and said they can be easily obtained even if the company was involved in transporting oil sold above the price cap.“What's likely is either these businesses will find the paperwork that they need to get through this process, or we'll see the <GPE>UK</GPE> government drop these cases quietly,” he said.He claimed the <GPE>US</GPE> were reluctant to make the Western sanctions regimes harder “because they're scared that if they do enforce the rules it will stop the <NORP>Russian</NORP> oil trade and that will send oil prices higher”.Conservative shadow foreign office minister Dame <PERSON>Harriett Baldwin</PERSON> said sanctions were designed to “shut down the sources of finance for <GPE>Russia</GPE>'s war machine” and “bring this illegal invasion to an end sooner”.She said “there is probably more that could be done” by the government and the oil sector itself “because it does appear that <GPE>UK</GPE> importers are still bringing in oil that originated in <GPE>Russia</GPE>\".It is important that when <ORG>OFSI</ORG> “find deliberate wrongdoing they are exacting financial penalties,” she added.A spokesperson for the <ORG>Treasury</ORG> said it would take enforcement action \"where appropriate\" and it was \"putting sanction breachers on notice\".They added that the cap was reducing <GPE>Russia</GPE>'s tax revenues from oil, adding that data from the country's own finance ministry showed a <PERCENT>30%</PERCENT> drop <DATE>last year</DATE> compared to <DATE>2022</DATE>.The former chair of <ORG>Parliament</ORG>’s <ORG>Treasury Select Committee</ORG> launched an inquiry into the effectiveness of sanctions on <GPE>Russia</GPE> in <DATE>February</DATE>.Dame <PERSON>Harriett</PERSON> said she “received evidence that the oil price cap is being evaded by refining <NORP>Russian</NORP> oil in refineries based in <ORDINAL>third</ORDINAL> countries and then the oil is being exported into the <GPE>UK</GPE>.”<DATE>Earlier this year</DATE> the <ORG>BBC</ORG> reported on claims about how much oil this so-called “loophole” is allowing into the <GPE>UK</GPE>.But parliamentary committees are disbanded once an election is called and the findings of the <ORG>Treasury</ORG> committee inquiry were never published.It is understood no decision has yet been made as to whether the new <ORG>Treasury Select Committee</ORG> will recommence the work.<ORG>OFSI</ORG> issued its <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> <GPE>Russia-related</GPE> penalty <DATE>last month</DATE>, when it fined a concierge company £<MONEY>15,000</MONEY> for having a sanctioned individual on its client list.<GPE>London-based</GPE> firm <ORG>Integral Concierge Services</ORG> was found to have made or received <CARDINAL>26</CARDINAL> payments that involved a person whose assets have been frozen as part of the <GPE>Russia</GPE> sanctions.The owner of a petrol station is warning drivers fuel prices could rise after the closure <DATE>next year</DATE>.As the conflict across <LOC>the Middle East</LOC> widens, rising oil prices are being closely watched.Any extended rise raises the possibility of higher petrol prices and gas and electricity bills.More households will be thinking about turning their heating on and the likely costs.Typical gas and electricity prices are rising by <PERCENT>10%</PERCENT> in <GPE>England</GPE>, <GPE>Scotland</GPE> and <GPE>Wales</GPE> on <DATE>1 October</DATE>."
"<PERSON>Marina Perederii’s</PERSON> home in the small mining city of <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE> in eastern <GPE>Ukraine</GPE> was her pride and joy.<CARDINAL>17</CARDINAL> <FAC>Sadova Street</FAC> was little more than a shell when she and her husband bought it.They lovingly renovated the house, painting cherry blossom and doves - symbols of love and well-being - in their bedroom.They built a swimming pool in the garden and a sauna in the basement.“Everything was planned with such passion,” she tells <ORG>the BBC World Service</ORG>.But the peace wasn’t to last.In <DATE>February 2022</DATE>, <GPE>Russia</GPE> launched its full-scale invasion of <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>.<PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s husband went to fight while she took their children and ran.Before fleeing, she recorded what she thought could be her <ORDINAL>last</ORDINAL> glimpse of their home.“My dear house, I don’t know if you will stand or not.I don’t know if we’ll ever return here... or if we’ll even survive at all,” she said in a video.The next time she saw her home was <DATE>a year later</DATE> in <DATE>February 2023</DATE>, through the eyes of a <NORP>Russian</NORP> soldier, in bodycam footage posted on social media.A marine going by the name <PERSON>Fima</PERSON> was in her living room, flicking through photos of <PERSON>Marina</PERSON> and her family.“Beautiful,” he said, looking at <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> photo.It was a chilling image that made her angry.“I wish I had taken the albums with me,” <PERSON>Marina</PERSON> says.<GPE>Ukraine</GPE> spent <DATE>two and a half years</DATE> defending <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE>, and although <NORP>Russian</NORP> forces had launched a major offensive in <DATE>2023</DATE>, they never fully managed to capture the city until <DATE>the start of October 2024</DATE>.During the long battle, as the front line shifted, <PERSON>Fima</PERSON> had led a group of soldiers to the suburbs in <DATE>late January 2023</DATE> and got caught in heavy fighting on <FAC>Sadova Street</FAC>.He and some others entered <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s home.As his bodycam footage went viral back home, <PERSON>Fima</PERSON> was hailed as a hero.Official documents show that he was recalled from the front in <DATE>February 2023</DATE> because of a leg wound.But what the footage didn’t show was that the <NORP>Russians</NORP> were keeping a <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> soldier captive in <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s basement, who was starving and in desperate need of medical care.His name was <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON>.Before the war, <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> worked as an IT specialist.When <GPE>Russia</GPE> invaded his country, he volunteered to fight and later became a drone operator in <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE>.His love of dancing earned him the nickname Dancer.When the <NORP>Russians</NORP> broke through <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> lines in <DATE>late January 2023</DATE>, <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> and his comrades tried to retreat, but some of them, including <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> were shot.Wounded, they were taken from house to house by <NORP>Russian</NORP> soldiers, with <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> eventually ending up in the basement of <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s home.He was held captive for almost a <DATE>month</DATE> - <NORP>Russian</NORP> footage uploaded online shows him wrapped in <CARDINAL>one</CARDINAL> of <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s carpets.During the battle for <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE> there was a point when the <NORP>Russian</NORP> soldiers retreated and they left <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> behind.In all he spent <DATE>46 days</DATE> in <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s house and for much of that time he had barely any food or water.Injured, starving and dehydrated, he was unable to leave the building.“I was able to find some crumbs on the floor,” he tells <ORG>the BBC World Service</ORG> from <GPE>Kyiv</GPE>.“There was a piece of cracker, which a mouse stole from me at <TIME>night</TIME>.I hid it, and then the mouse probably stole it because I couldn’t find it.”But hunger was nothing compared to thirst.<DATE>One day</DATE>, after the <NORP>Russians</NORP> had left, the desperate need for water almost killed <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON>.He tore panels from a sauna in the hope that there might be water inside the pipes.He managed to break one open and drank some of the liquid inside, but it was antifreeze.Those few sips caused internal burns and were nearly fatal.Then, in <DATE>March that year</DATE>, when <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> forces retook parts of <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE> and reached <FAC>Sadova Street</FAC>, another video from <PERSON>Marina</PERSON>’s home went viral.It shows ex-New <GPE>Zealand</GPE> soldier <PERSON>Kane Te Tai</PERSON> entering number <CARDINAL>17</CARDINAL> and finding <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON>.“<GPE>New Zealand</GPE>, <GPE>New Zealand</GPE>, it’s me!”<PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> shouts at his colleague, who had travelled to fight for <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>.<PERSON>Te Tai</PERSON> died in battle <DATE>just two weeks later</DATE>.<PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> was carried out of the house and to safety.Had he been left <DATE>just a few more days</DATE>, <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> says he wouldn’t have made it.Several other <NORP>Ukrainian</NORP> and <NORP>Russian</NORP> soldiers are known to have died in and around <FAC>Sadova Street</FAC> during the battle for <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE>.“Thank God <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON> survived.But the fact that people died in my house, it shocked me,” <PERSON>Marina</PERSON> says.“There is only death in there.”<ORG>The BBC World Service</ORG> asked <ORG>the Russian Ministry of Defence</ORG> about <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON>’s treatment but received no response.<DATE>Half a year</DATE> after <PERSON>Oleksii</PERSON>’s rescue, his <NORP>Russian</NORP> captor was being lauded at home.He was no longer just referred to by his call sign, <PERSON>Fima</PERSON>, but by his first name, <PERSON>Andrei</PERSON>.State TV footage shows him re-enacting the <GPE>Vuhledar</GPE> assault and sharing his experiences with primary school children, where teachers present him as a hero.The <ORG>BBC</ORG> compared this footage with photographs of <PERSON>Andrei</PERSON> from <CARDINAL>hundreds</CARDINAL> of social media profiles and found a match -
