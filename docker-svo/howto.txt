Key Improvements and Changes:
FastAPI Instead of Flask:
Replaced Flask with FastAPI for asynchronous handling and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
Updated the endpoint to use @app.post("/bulk_load") with FastAPI's dependency injection.
Used FastAPI's FileResponse to return the PNG image.
Pydantic Model for Input Validation:
Added Record and BulkInput Pydantic models to enforce that each JSON record has a text field.
Input must be a JSON array of objects, each with a text string field (e.g., [{"text": "The cat chased the mouse"}, {"text": "The dog ate the bone"}]).
FastAPI automatically validates the input and returns appropriate error messages if the schema is invalid.
Docker Compose Updates:
Changed the port to 8000 (common for FastAPI with Uvicorn).
Updated the command in the Dockerfile to run uvicorn instead of python app.py.
Requirements Updates:
Replaced flask with fastapi and uvicorn.
Added pydantic for input validation.
Kept requests, networkx, and matplotlib for LM-Studio integration and graph generation.
Temporary File for FileResponse:
FastAPI's FileResponse requires a file path, so the PNG buffer is saved to a temporary file.
The temporary file is automatically cleaned up after the response is sent.
Error Handling:
Used FastAPI's HTTPException for error responses with appropriate status codes.
Maintained robust error handling for LM-Studio communication and graph generation.
Usage Instructions:
Ensure LM-Studio is running externally on port 1234 (accessible via host.docker.internal:1234 on Docker Desktop).
Save the provided files (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, app.py) in a project directory.
Run docker-compose up --build to start the service.
Send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/bulk_load with a JSON payload like:
json

{
    "records": [
        {"text": "The cat chased the mouse."},
        {"text": "The dog ate the bone."}
    ]
}
The response will be a PNG image (digraph.png) showing the directed graph of subject-verb-object relationships.
Notes:
The LM_STUDIO_URL environment variable defaults to http://localhost:1234/v1 if not set.
For Linux users, replace host.docker.internal with the host machine's IP or configure Docker networking appropriately.
The generated digraph visualizes subjects and objects as nodes, with edges labeled by verbs, using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
FastAPI provides automatic API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.
This solution maintains the same artifact IDs as the previous response where applicable, as it updates the existing application rather than creating a new one.
