Object Graphs: In computer science, object graphs represent a network of objects connected through their relationships, either directly or indirectly. These relationships are modeled as edges between nodes (objects) in a directed graph, which may be cyclic.
Knowledge Graphs: Knowledge graphs are a type of graph data structure that represents entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) as triples (subject-predicate-object). This allows for the storage and querying of semantic facts and schema models.
RDF Triplestore: RDF triplestores are a specific type of graph database that stores semantic facts as subject-predicate-object triples. This format enables the representation of relationships between entities using Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) as unique identifiers.
Subject-Verb Agreement: In grammar, subject-verb agreement refers to the rule that the verb should agree with the subject (singular or plural) in number. This applies to sentences with compound subjects connected by “or” or “nor”.
Subject-Verb-Object Word Order: In linguistic typology, the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order is a common sentence structure where the subject comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object.

Key Takeaways:
Graph relationships can be represented as directed edges between nodes (objects) or as subject-predicate-object triples.
Knowledge graphs and RDF triplestores are specific types of graph databases designed for storing and querying semantic facts.
Subject-verb agreement in grammar ensures that the verb agrees with the subject in number.
The subject-verb-object word order is a common sentence structure in many languages.
